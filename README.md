# Floppy-Bird
This is a game I have made during the CodeGorilla Bootcamp. It is made using the Unity game engine over the course of a couple of days. The objective fly through as many openings without hitting the pillars. The floppy can move up with the left mouse button and will fly on its own at the same speed all the time.

What I have done for this project:
- Come up with the idea.
- Set up UI.
- Written the game logic (in C#).

  - The artwork was done by Riccardo Parrello (Github username: riccardoparrello)
  - Except for the background where I used the unity background.
